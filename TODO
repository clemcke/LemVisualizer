The goal:

To create a visualizer library that can draw complicated visualization sequences using a simplified api or descriptive language
Example:
Visualizer.new(:height => 1280, :width => 720, :visualizations => [:simple_circles])

extract visualizer.rb to a module
create sample.rb that includes visualizer and runs it
create tests that at least test that each function runs
   test that certain attributes are accessible
